# Applied Machine Learning Bootcamp for Learning Analytics

<b>Summary</b>: The aim of the hands-on workshop is to become proficient in core machine learning techniques for learning analytics. We will use python as the programming language but introduce key libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikitlrn, statsmodels, keras, and tensorflow.
