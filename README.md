# Introduction to Machine Learning for Learning Analytics

## Summary

The hands-on workshop will provide a rigorous introduction to machine learning for learning analytics practitioners. Participants will learn to use <i>python</i> along with key data science libraries such as pandas, scikitlrn, statsmodels, and tensorflow. The workshop will consist of four parts: a) python refresher; b) data science fundamentals; c) machine learning; and d) deep learning. Data sets and methodologies will emphasize current problems and challenges in learning analytics. 

## Target Audience, Prerequisites

Participant should know basic python. A self-contained basic python course (approximately 5 hours) will be made available to participants in early April. Participants are highly encouraged to take the online course or complete the assessments to evaluate their level of proficiency. The basic python course will also contain a brief introduction to the Jupyter Notebook environment.  The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application for creatong and sharing documents with live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The workshop will make extensive use of the Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Pedagogy, Activities

Proficiency in machine learning requires skill sets in computation, mathematics, and statistics. Because machine learning can be a very heavy lift for novices, our approach emphasizes a three step learning process: concept, theory, and practice. The concept step presents the intuition; the theory step elaborates the intuition formally; the practice step synthesizes the learning with live code. Each machine learning module will culminate in a case study. Participants will work in teams to work on the case study.

The entire workshop is structured with learning objectives. Corresponding to each learning objective there are aligned activities and assessments. After the workshop participants will have full access to an online environment containing course instructional materials and follow-up learning activities.
