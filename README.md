# Applied Machine Learning Bootcamp for Learning Analytics

<b>Summary</b>: The hands-on workshop will provide a rigorous introduction to machine learning for learning analytics practitioners. We will use python as the programming language but introduce key libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikitlrn, statsmodels, keras, and tensorflow. The workshop will consist of four parts: a) python refresher; b) data science fundamentals; c) machine learning; and d) deep learning. Data sets and methodologies will be
